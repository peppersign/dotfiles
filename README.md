# dotfiles

Personal dotfiles since I'm trying to get into this rice thing. For now I'm with a basic setup.
Here I'll be documenting what I've done till now. But with time this will be overwritten with new
changes.


```
Changes made:
------------

-> Status bar script (btw, icons by fontawesome)
-> Keybindings for basic stuff
-> Colorscheme setup with pywal
-> USB mounter script (concept from LukeSmith)
-> Using dunst notifier
-> Basic screenshoot tool with mss in python
-> Monitor setup with xrandr
-> (Writing a basic fetch tool)
```

Actually using dwm as WM, but planning to shift to i3-gaps with polybar.
Using ST as terminal emulator, tried urxvt but I'll stick with st.


## setup

I'll be updating this repository over time with new scripts and changes. But rn the actual
setup has been very comfy so no problem.
